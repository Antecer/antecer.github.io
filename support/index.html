                                General shipping time is 2-3 weeks, but be warned that it may vary some depending on
                                your country of residence, as well as other factors such as holidays (and currently
                                covid). Some parcels may take up to a month plus, although these cases are quite rare.
                                Certain countries like the US and UK tend to be quicker.

                                The connector pins on the bottom of the switches are prone to bending and snapping. Pull
                                out the switch(es) you’re experiencing problems with and check if they are damaged. If
                                they are, see “Are your switch pins bent” under. If not, the problem might lie in the
                                keypads’ hotswap connectors. In this case, you can see

                                As stated, the connector pins are rather fragile. If they are bent you can try bending
                                them back, but be careful as they might snap. If they’ve snapped, you can buy new
                                switches or try to fix the broken one. This can be done by replacing the switch housing
                                with the broken connector(s) with one that is in good condition. See
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/E7NrOuLryUA?t=211">here</a>. One way you could
                                try straightening them out is by grabbing a pair of pliers, and gently squeezing the
                                bent pin into a close to original shape. You can normally use your fingers, but consider
                                using the prior method if your pin is bent greatly out of shape.

                            <div class="answer">
                                Consider buying a new USB-C data cable to use with the keypad. The cable that comes with
                                the keypad can be faulty and lead to the keypad not functioning as it should. Double
                                check that the cable is transferring power and data as it should by plugging it into
                                another USB-C compatible device if you have one.<br />
                                In some instances, the keypad does not function when plugged into certain USB ports. Try
                                plugging your keypad into different ports (front/rear I/O, USB 2.0 and 3.0 etc.) on your
                                computer to see if there is any difference.
